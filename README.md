ASP.NET README
This README provides an overview of various ASP.NET concepts and functionalities implemented in this project.
    
Action Selector
Action selectors are used in ASP.NET to determine which action method of a controller should be invoked in response to a request. They provide a way to route incoming requests to the appropriate action method based on various criteria such as HTTP verbs, parameters, or route attributes.

Codebase
The codebase of this project encompasses all the source code files, configurations, and assets required to build and run the ASP.NET application. It includes controllers, views, models, and other necessary components.

Code First Approach
Code First Approach refers to a development workflow in which you define your application's domain model using plain old C# classes (POCO) and then let Entity Framework generate the corresponding database schema based on these classes.

ControllerToView
ControllerToView demonstrates the process of passing data from a controller to a view in ASP.NET. It showcases how to populate a view with dynamic data retrieved from the controller.

ControllerToView1
Similar to ControllerToView, ControllerToView1 illustrates the process of passing data from a controller to a view. It may showcase a different approach or scenario compared to ControllerToView.

ControllerWithJSON
ControllerWithJSON exemplifies how to return JSON data from a controller action method in ASP.NET. This can be useful for building APIs or AJAX endpoints.

Database First
Database First is an approach in Entity Framework where the entity model is generated from an existing database schema. It involves reverse-engineering the database to create corresponding entity classes.

First_Core_App
First_Core_App is a basic ASP.NET Core application serving as a starting point for beginners. It may include essential features such as routing, controllers, views, and models.

FormTagHelper
FormTagHelper demonstrates the usage of tag helpers in ASP.NET Core, particularly for creating HTML forms. Tag helpers simplify the process of generating HTML elements within Razor views.

ModelDemo
ModelDemo showcases the implementation of models in ASP.NET MVC. Models represent the application's data structure and business logic.

ModelToView
ModelToView demonstrates how to pass a model object from a controller to a view and render its data within the view using Razor syntax.

MyController
MyController is a sample controller class within the ASP.NET application. It contains action methods responsible for handling incoming requests and generating appropriate responses.

RegistrationForm
RegistrationForm is an example of an ASP.NET form used for user registration. It may include fields for capturing user details such as name, email, and password.
